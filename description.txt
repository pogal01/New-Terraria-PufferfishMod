The Pufferfish mod. This is my first mod I have ever made on terraria.
I'm not very good at codeing so it took me ages and I had to look at many tutorils. Sorry if anything in the tutoril files still remain. 

The reason I made this mod was because I love pufferfish. 
This mod does what it sounds like adds pufferfish to the game. They are found in the ocean.
There are two types of pufferfish the first being a normal pufferfish and the second being a luckyfinned pufferfish (Finding nemo refrence). 

The normal pufferfish will drop a spike when it dies and a Lucyfinned pufferfish will drop a fin.

You can make a spikeed fin club with two fins and eight spikes.

you can upgrade that in hard mode to create the true spikey finned club.

you can create a gun called the angry puffer blaster in hard mode aswell.

you can turn spikes into spikey bullets so you can use them in the puffer blaster.

And a unobtanable pet.

As I said this is my first mod also it is still in development so expect buggs and glitches.

I'm also sorry this mod has not got much content in it yet.
